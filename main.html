        <p>My name is Miriah Peterson. I may not be the most interesting person, but I do have my own website, and that is what is really important.</p>
        <h4>A little about me</h4>

        <img class="profile_pic" src="/Users/mpeterson/code/Udacity/Responsive_Portfolio_Site/image/18403764_10208339393513763_3284591566930209858_o.jpg" alt="profile_pic">

            <p>I am a 24 year old millennial.  I don't really care about being a millennial, but I will own it. I am the 8th of 9 children and there is a huge spread of age among my siblings (40-20) which has given me a unique childhood and growing up experience and has really shaped who I am today. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am very devoted to my faith and it has given me a lot of strength in times of trial and hardship. From April 2013-October 2014 I server a mission for my church in Montevideo, Uruguay. This was a great growing period of my life. It helped me come closer to God and find out who I am as a person.</p>
            If I were to make a dating profile things I would include for “compatibility”:
            <div class="list">
            <ul><li>I love Latin Dancing and that is kind of a deal breaker.</li>
                <li>I love going to the movies but will not pay for myself.</li>
                <li>I am the most uncoordinated person you'll ever meet, but I do lift bro.</li>
                <li>Physics is my life, it is my thing, it is what I do.</li>
                <li>My take-out go-to will always be street tacos or chik-fil-a.</li>
                <li>I have a life goal to speak Spanish like it was my first language.</li></ul>
            </div>
            <p>I am not a blogger, but in my efforts to build a website for the purpose of promoting my non-existent coding career I accidentally set up a blog. I could change it, re-work the site, but that is honestly too much.<img> So now I have this blog, and I guess if I post things to my self-titled website I am in fact a blogger. I try to use this website to express myself, how I am feeling, what I am going through, and how I overcome life’s struggles. I hope you enjoy.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Brigham Young University in August 2017 with a BS in Physics. During my undergraduate years I help several jobs in related to my major. From 2015-2017 I worked and a Research Assistant under Dr. Justin Peatross. <img>My research was in the field of optics specifically relating to harmonic laser scattering.</p><p> During that time I also worked as a teachers assistant to several professors in the physics department. As a TA I gained lost of experience leading groups,<img> communicating complex ideas, and providing emotional support to stressed out pre-med students.</p><p>Since graduating I have been working at a backend developer at a FinTech company. I have experience using Go, Docker, NSQ, Kafka, Protobuf, Jira, and Scrum.
