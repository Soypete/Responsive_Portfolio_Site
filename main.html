                        <p>I am a 24 year old millennial. I don't really care about being a millennial, but I will own it. I
                            am the 8th of 9 children and there is a huge spread of age among my siblings (40-20) which has
                            given me a unique childhood and growing up experience and has really shaped who I am today. I
                            am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am very devoted to my faith
                            and it has given me a lot of strength in times of trial and hardship. From April 2013-October
                            2014 I server a mission for my church in Montevideo, Uruguay. This was a great growing period
                            of my life. It helped me come closer to God and find out who I am as a person.</p>

                    <p>I am not a blogger, but in my efforts to build a website for the purpose of promoting my non-existent
                        coding career I accidentally set up a blog. I could change it, re-work the site, but that is honestly
                        too much. So now I have this blog, and I guess if I post things to my self-titled website I am in
                        fact a blogger. I try to use this website to express myself, how I am feeling, what I am going through,
                        and how I overcome life’s struggles. I hope you enjoy.

                        <p>I graduated from Brigham Young University in August 2017 with a BS in Physics. During my undergraduate
                            years I help several jobs in related to my major. From 2015-2017 I worked and a Research Assistant
                            under Dr. Justin Peatross. My research was in the field of optics specifically relating to harmonic
                            laser scattering.</p>
                        <p> During that time I also worked as a teachers assistant to several professors in the physics department.
                            As a TA I gained lost of experience leading groups, communicating complex ideas, and providing
                            emotional support to stressed out pre-med students.</p>
                        <p>Since graduating I have been working at a backend developer at a FinTech company. I have experience
                            using Go, Docker, NSQ, Kafka, Protobuf, Jira, and Scrum. Additionally I have been working on
                            the Udacity Fronend nanodegree to better my developing skills and broaden my horizons.</p>
